Version 1.4 Released 28 June 2023
- changed spectral generation function
   * used to generate peaks in nm space, which could lead to distored peaks (see below)
   * ref: http://iopenshell.usc.edu/resources/howto/spectra.pdf
   * tested on a few spectra. the difference seems minimal in case where peaks are far apart.
   * difference noticable when peaks are close together.


Version 1.3 Released 22 May 2023
- added ability to plot experimental absorption spectrum
- fixed bugs
   * ymax option not always working
   * hold plot box not always working
   * cleaning of functions

Version 1.2 Released 27 April 2023
- fixed error in width for Gaussian distribution
